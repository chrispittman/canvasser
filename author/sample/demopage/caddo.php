                        <div class="">For many years, archeologists have been studying the abandoned places where ancient Caddo people lived. They search for clues about what Caddo life was like hundreds of years ago. These clues may be objects, such as pottery, or they may be stains and patterns in the soil where a village once stood.</div>
                        <div class="">In the sections below, you can learn more about how archeologists learn about the ancient Caddo world. In our "Virtual Museum," you can look at some of the objects the Caddo left behind. You will see the unusual pottery they made, the types of jewelry they wore, and the precious items they buried in their mysterious mounds. As you look at these objects, perhaps you will get a better feeling for what ancient Caddo life was like.</div>

After the pots dried for a few days, sharp sticks were used to "engrave" designs on some of them. After polishing with a smooth stone, the vessels were fired in an open wood fire to "bake" them and make them strong.</div>

                        Shown in order of their removal by analysts at the University of Texas in 1936 . Radiocarbon dated to ca. 4200 cal. B.P., during the time that the monumental Pecos River Style rock art began to flourish, the cache offers a rare--if enigmatic--glimpse into the traditions of Lower Pecos people. Reflecting both the mundane and sacred, the bag has been described as a hunter's pouch and a medicine bundle. Photo by James Neely, TARL Archives
