<div class="">Arthur Koblenz Dallas[1] (portrayed by Tom Skerritt) is the captain of the Nostromo and the only human crew member with access to MOTHER, the on-board computer. Upon receiving the distress signal from the Engineer ship, the Derelict, Dallas follows the protocol of detouring the Nostromo away from its course, in order to investigate the beacon. After the Alien has hatched from Gilbert Kane's chest and murdered Samuel Brett, Dallas opts to enter the ship's air ducts, to lure it to the airlock and eject it into space. He is subsequently attacked by the Alien and disappears, leaving only behind his flamethrower.

When Tom Skerritt first read the screenplay for Alien, he declined to be involved, as he was unimpressed with the writing quality and the low budget. After the screenplay was edited and the budget enhanced, Skerritt was approached again, which prompted him to sign on. Halfway through production, he approached the writer and executive producer Ronald Shusett, asking if he could trade his salary for half a percentage point of royalties.[2] One prominent scene cut from the film features Ellen Ripley detouring from her escape from the Nostromo, to discover Dallas alive in the Alien nest, which she destroys, as an act of mercy.
