I think there's something wrong with the fade animation in canvasser.
If I add it through the animation panel, it'll have startalpha but not endalpha in the json file.
It still works once I manually put endalpha and a value for it in the json


DONE:
2017-07-14 Settings cached option (bool) added - defaults to use cached
2017-07-14 Canvasser Init now grabs previous x,y mouse position for loadInto
2017-07-14 loadInto now stops the loop - not sure if 100% fixed but seems okay
