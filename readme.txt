Canvasser TODO:

Wait until all images are loaded before displaying anything

Settings UI Broken
From current on animations acting weird

I think there's something wrong with the fade animation in canvasser.
If I add it through the animation panel, it'll have startalpha but not endalpha in the json file.
It still works once I manually put endalpha and a value for it in the json
Samples are getting placed in exported JSON.

DONE:

2017-07-18 Conditional position and variable added to UI.

2017-07-14 Canvasser Init now grabs previous x,y mouse position for loadInto
2017-07-14 loadInto now stops the loop - not sure if 100% fixed but seems okay
